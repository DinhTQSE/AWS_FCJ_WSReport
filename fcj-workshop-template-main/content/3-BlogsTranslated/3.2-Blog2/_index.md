# HOW TO SAVE MONEY ON CLOUD: 10 SIMPLE TIPS FOR SCHOOLS

This blog post shows schools and universities how to spend less money when using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The writer talks about why it is important to watch your spending and gives 10 easy tips. These tips help schools use cloud services well while not spending too much money. The main idea is to use only what you need, not more than you need.

## Why Save Money on Cloud

* In the past, schools had to buy computers and equipment for the highest number of users they might have.
* Cloud services let you use only what you need right now and not buy extra things.
* Many schools forget this when they first start using cloud services.
* Schools need to watch their cloud spending carefully to get the best value for their money.

## Simple Money-Saving Tips (1-5)

**1. Set Up Spending Alerts**
* Use AWS Budgets to get warnings when you spend too much money
* This helps you know when your bills are getting high
* Very helpful for free services so you don't get surprised when they are not free anymore

**2. Use the Right Size of Resources**
* Find computers (EC2), databases (RDS), or storage (EBS) that are too big for what you need
* Think about using smaller sizes or different types that cost less
* Use AWS tools to get suggestions on better sizes
* Keep checking this because your needs change over time

**3. Use Spot Instances**
* For work that can wait or stop and start again, use EC2 Spot Instances
* These can save up to 90% of money compared to normal prices
* Good for research work that doesn't need to run all the time

**4. Turn Off Computers When Not Needed**
* Set up rules to turn off EC2 computers during nights and weekends
* Use AWS tools to do this automatically
* This saves money for things you don't need running 24 hours a day

**5. Use Smart Storage Rules**
* Make S3 storage cheaper by moving old files to cheaper storage
* Use Glacier for files you don't need often
* Use AWS tools to see which files you can move

## More Money-Saving Tips (6-10)

**6. Check Your Backup Rules**
* Look at how long you keep backup copies of your data
* Important work might need to keep backups for many years
* Test work doesn't need backups for so long

**7. Use Smart Storage That Changes Automatically**
* Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering moves your files to cheaper storage when you don't use them much
* This happens automatically so you don't have to think about it

**8. Delete Old Unused Files**
* Find and delete storage that is not connected to anything
* Delete old snapshots and incomplete uploads
* Use AWS tools to manage this automatically

**9. Put Multiple Accounts Together**
* If your school has many AWS accounts, put them under fewer main accounts
* This can help you get discounts and save money on data transfer
* Consider using CloudFront to save money on internet traffic

**10. Use Savings Plans and Reserved Instances**
* If you use EC2, Lambda, SageMaker, or RDS regularly, buy them for 1-3 years
* This can save up to 72% compared to normal prices
* Make sure you have the right sizes before buying these plans
