During my internship at **First Cloud Journey (AWS Vietnam)** from **September 2025** to **November 2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply cloud computing knowledge in a real-world AWS environment.  
I participated in a **12-week intensive AWS learning program**, building an IoT Smart Device Management System while mastering **10+ core AWS services** including Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFront, IoT Core, and implementing Infrastructure as Code with Terraform. Through this hands-on project, I significantly improved my skills in **cloud architecture design, serverless development, DevOps automation, security implementation (IAM, WAF), and AWS best practices**.  

In terms of work ethic, I demonstrated strong self-directed learning, consistently completed weekly milestones, maintained detailed documentation throughout the project, and actively participated in AWS community events and workshops to deepen my cloud computing knowledge.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:
