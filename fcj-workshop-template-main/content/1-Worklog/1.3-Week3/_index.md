### Week 3 Achievements:

* Completed theoretical modules:  
  * Understood **EC2 basics** and instance lifecycle.  
  * Learned about **AMI, Backup, Key Pair, EBS, and Instance Store**.  
  * Explored **User Data & Meta Data** for automation and instance information.  
  * Studied **EC2 Auto Scaling** for scalability and cost optimization.  

* Completed lab exercises:  
  * Successfully launched **Windows and Linux EC2 instances**.  
  * Configured **security groups and key pairs** for secure access.  
  * Deployed **AWS User Management** (Node.js CRUD app) on both Linux and Windows instances.  

* Deliverables:  
  * Submitted **Worklog Week 3**.  
  * Running demo of AWS User Management accessible through EC2 public DNS.  

### Week 3 Reflections:

- Practicing with **both Windows and Linux EC2** helped me understand differences in deployment and management.  
- I saw how important **security groups and key pairs** are in controlling access.  
- The Node.js CRUD app deployment gave me real-world experience connecting **EC2 instances with MySQL**.  
- This week helped me bridge the gap between **theory (videos, modules)** and **practice (lab, deployment)**.
