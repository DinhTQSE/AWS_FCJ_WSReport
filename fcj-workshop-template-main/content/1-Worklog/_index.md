## Project Overview

This worklog documents a **12-week learning journey** (September - November 2025) focused on mastering **AWS Cloud Computing** through hands-on development of an IoT Smart Device Management System. The project serves as a practical vehicle to learn and apply core AWS services, cloud architecture principles, and modern DevOps practices.

### Learning Objectives

The primary goal was to gain comprehensive understanding of **AWS Cloud Computing fundamentals and core services** through hands-on practice:

**Core AWS Services:**
- **Compute**: EC2, Lambda (serverless functions)
- **Storage**: S3 (object storage), EBS, CloudFront (CDN)
- **Database**: DynamoDB (NoSQL), RDS concepts
- **Networking**: VPC, Security Groups, Route 53
- **Security & Identity**: IAM (users, roles, policies), WAF, Shield
- **Monitoring & Management**: CloudWatch (metrics, logs, alarms)
- **IoT & Integration**: IoT Core, API Gateway, EventBridge
- **Developer Tools**: CodePipeline, CodeBuild, Amplify

**Cloud Architecture Principles:**
- **Infrastructure as Code** (Terraform) for automated provisioning
- **Serverless architecture patterns** and best practices
- **Security-first design** with least privilege access
- **Cost optimization** strategies for cloud resources
- **High availability & scalability** design patterns
- **AWS Well-Architected Framework** implementation

### Development Timeline

The project followed an agile methodology with weekly sprints, progressing from foundational AWS knowledge through to production-ready deployment:

**Week 1-7:** [Foundation & Planning Phase](1.1-week1/) - AWS fundamentals, architecture design, and project planning

**Week 8:** [Hardware & IoT Integration](1.8-week8/) - Core pipeline development, sensor integration, AWS IoT Core setup

**Week 9:** [Authentication & API Development](1.9-week9/) - Hybrid authentication system, Lambda functions, API Gateway configuration

**Week 10:** [Frontend Development & Deployment](1.10-week10/) - Web interface, S3/CloudFront deployment, end-to-end testing

**Week 11:** [Infrastructure as Code & CI/CD](1.11-week11/) - Terraform implementation, automated pipelines, security hardening (WAF, monitoring)

**Week 12:** [Testing & Documentation](1.12-week12/) - System optimization, final testing, documentation, and project delivery

### Key Learning Outcomes

✅ **Hands-on experience** with 10+ core AWS services
✅ **Serverless architecture mastery** - Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB
✅ **IoT data pipeline** implementation with AWS IoT Core and rules engine
✅ **Cloud security implementation** - IAM policies, WAF rules, encryption
✅ **Infrastructure as Code proficiency** - Terraform for AWS resource management
✅ **CI/CD automation skills** - CodePipeline, Amplify deployment workflows
✅ **Cloud monitoring & observability** - CloudWatch dashboards, alarms, and logs
✅ **Cost-aware architecture** - Serverless computing and pay-per-use services

### Technologies Used

**Cloud Services:** AWS IoT Core, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFront, CloudWatch, WAF, Shield

**Infrastructure:** Terraform, AWS CodePipeline, AWS Amplify

**Hardware:** ESP32, MQ-3 Sensor, MAX30102 Sensor, AS608 Fingerprint Module

**Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)

**Development:** Git, VS Code, AWS CLI

This worklog provides detailed weekly documentation of the **AWS learning journey**, including hands-on exercises, challenges encountered, AWS services explored, and practical skills gained throughout the 12-week cloud computing program.
